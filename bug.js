In Next.js, a less common error arises when using server-side props or getStaticProps with data fetching that isn't properly handled for edge cases.  For example, if your data fetching function throws an error but doesn't handle it gracefully, Next.js might not render a proper error page, leading to a blank screen or an unexpected error message.  This can happen when network requests fail, data is malformed, or there are database errors.  The problem is often harder to debug than usual client-side errors because the error might not show up in your browser's developer console directly.
