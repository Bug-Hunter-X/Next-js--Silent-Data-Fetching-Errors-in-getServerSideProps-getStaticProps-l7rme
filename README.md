# Next.js Silent Data Fetching Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky bug in Next.js applications: unhandled errors during data fetching within `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`. These errors can lead to blank screens or unhelpful error messages, making debugging difficult.

## The Problem

When fetching data (e.g., from an API or database) within `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`, errors are not always gracefully handled.  A network failure or database error might result in an error being thrown, but without proper error handling, Next.js won't display a user-friendly error message.  Instead, you'll likely see a blank page or a vague JavaScript error in the browser's console, making it hard to pinpoint the issue.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the behavior (or lack thereof) when network calls fail.

## Solution

The solution involves comprehensive error handling within your data fetching functions.  Always use `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors, and return an appropriate error object from your `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` function. This object can then be used in your component to render a custom error message or fallback UI.
